    "\n",
    "**Metadata**: listed outside of the main plot using printed numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Depth**: The depth is displayed inverse-linearly on the y-axis, with each horizontal line signifying 200 km distance increments. There is a consistely dark line at the top of the plot which represents 0 km and therefore immediate reflection. The ISIS-1 ionograms typically go to a height of 5000 km while the ISIS-2 ionograms only go to 3300 km. Moreover, ISIS-1 had an apogee of ~3500 km while ISIS-2 had an apogee of ~1500 km\n",

    "**Frequency**: the frequency is not displayed in a consistent linear scale like the depth but the vertical lines are at known MHz values forboth ISIS 1 and ISIS 2 the frequency goes up to 20 MHz. "
