## TODO


-  Optimize an OCR to translate metadata located on the bottom: 
	- Starting code can be found in /scan2data/metadata_translation/bottom_metadata
- Develop a method to assess noisy ionograms
	- 	Starting code can be found in /scan2data/ionogram_content_extraction/draft_ionogram_noise_assesment.py
- Optimize curve fitting to the ionogram trace
	- 	Starting code can be found in /scan2data/ionogram_content_extraction/draft_trace_curve_fitting.py
- Optimize ways to separate the ionogram traces
	- 	Starting code can be found in /scan2data/ionogram_content_extraction/draft_trace_clustering.p
- Develop methods to extract more parameters such as foF2
- Develop methods to determination of electron density values
- Implement a database to organize the dataset based on its metadata
- Develop an interactive graphical user interface
