    "There are two potentail issues with the scanning we are trying to isolate and get an idea for how prevelant they are:\r\n",
    "1. Images are cropped too soon (causes aspect ratio to be less wide than expected)\r\n",
    "2. Images are out of phase (can see two sets of metadata on either side of ionogram instead of middle)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Issue 1 is the easiest to detect by just reading in the pixel scale and calculating the aspect ratio, wheras for Issue 2 we need to use an optical character regonition program to estimate the number of digits in the metadata. Both of these cause us to not be able to see the ionogram trace correctly. Images like first and last ones of most subdirs are supposed to be off and not have the normal ionogram aspect ratios so it is normal to expect a certain small rate of these images."

    "- The metadata we are interested in is expected to be at the bottom of the image, below the ionogram graph\r\n",
    "- Including the data from the ionogram graph makes the keras_ocr functions more likely to predict random words from the noise, so its best to lower the chances of this by cropping the image\r\n",
    "- Some images are upsidedown or for another reason will have their metadata cut off due to the crop but it is okay for us to underestimate, and this is preffered when compared to overestimating\r\n",
    "- There are some images which contain just long sections of metadata and these are not out of phase but would contribute to an overestimation and so cropping bottom 20% opposed to bottom 200 pixels allows us to filter out the characters on those images from view\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "^ In general this is also much more efficient since 80% less pixels need to be processed but now that we are interested in detecting ISIS text in the entire image we feed 100% of the pixels to the predictor so it really no longer helps much with processing time."
